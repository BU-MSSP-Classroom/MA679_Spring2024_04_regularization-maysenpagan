### Stein's Estimator and shrinkage
So far, we have seen how least squares perform well, even in cases where the true model is not linear.  Then, the natural question we may ask is, can we find an estimator that is better than least squares?  Which @stein1956inadmissibility worked on, and later @james1961estimation improved upon. It is called the James-Stein estimator or just Stein's estimator.  

Stein's estimator is defined as \footnote{In general Stein estimator is $(1-\alpha)\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ for some positive number $\alpha$ less than 1.  }
$$\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{stein}=\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$$.

According to Stein, for $p>2$
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\parallel \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{stein} - \boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}\parallel^2\leq E\parallel \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS} -\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}\parallel^2
\end{eqnarray*}

To put it in simple English, the estimator obtained by shirking the LS estimator by $\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)$ is a better estimator than LS.  This is puzzling if you think carefully about it, given that LS is BLUE. Also, there is not even a tuning parameter. The only thing that seems to matter is $\frac{\sigma^2}{\parallel \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}$.  The proof is not hard; you can find it at the bottom.  But the important takeaway message is that we can do better than LS by shrinking the estimates.

### Methods to Control Model Complexity

Regression is used for a variety of problems 
  - prediction: stock price in the future
	- estimation: denoising, smoothing
	- understanding: figure out what variable(s) are important

A critical characteristic in all situations is that we want a generalizable model. Thus, we often prefer a simpler model over a complex model (why?).  This principle is called Occam's razor.  (Note that a simpler model does not guarantee generalizability. )
What methods are available for us to control the model complexity?

For orthogonal $X_j$ $j=1,\cdots,p$, we can use the shrinkage method as we saw in the Stein estimator $$\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}\parallel^2}\right)$$

Another method is to use a threshold.  There is hard thresholding, where we set all the coefficients that do not pass a certain threshold to zero.
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\beta}_j=\hat{\beta}_j1_{\hat{\beta}_j>\lambda}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\hat{\beta}_j & \mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid > \lambda\\
0 &\verb|otherwise|\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}
An alternative is soft thresholding, where we combine shrinkage with hard thresholding.
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\beta}_j=sgn(\hat{\beta}_j)[\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid-\lambda]_{+}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\tilde{\beta}_j=\hat{\beta}_j-\lambda & \verb|if |\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid > \lambda\\
\tilde{\beta}_j=0 & \verb|if |\mid\hat{\beta}_j\mid \leq \lambda \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{eqnarray}

But what can we do in a more general case where $X$ is not orthogonal or $p$ is bigger than $n$?  One popular thing nowadays is putting a penalty or constraint on the model complexity.  The two most popular ways are the subset selection and shrinkage methods.

#### subset selection

Subset selection is most commonly done by restricting the number of none zero $\tilde{\beta}_j$ to be less than some constant $k$.  But solving that is unfeasible when $p$ is large since it is an N-P hard problem.   In the orthogonal $X$ situation, ordering the $\tilde{\beta}_j$ and choosing $k$ largest subset selection is equivalent to hard thresholding.

#### Shrinkage

For general $X$, we can also perform shrinkage. The idea is to minimize $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2$ subject to some constraint.  When we set the constraint as $\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2<t$, the result is called the ridge regression.  Similarly, if we choose the constraint as $\mid\boldsymbol{\beta}\mid<t$, then the result is known as the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression.  It turns out that this constrained minimization problem can be generalized to minimizing an objective function of the form $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel_{L_p}$ where $\parallel \parallel_{L_p}$ is called the $L_p$ norm and $\lambda$ is the complexity parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage.

##### Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is used when you don't have collinearity in your predictor variables.  We can consider it a constraint optimization under the $l_2$ norm or shrinkage estimation. So, for a general setting:

observation  | predictor 1     | predictor 2     | $\cdots$ | predictor p     | response 
-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|----------
1            | $x_{11}$        | $x_{12}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{1p}$        | $y_1$
2            | $x_{21}$        | $x_{22}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{2p}$        | $y_2$
$\vdots$     | $\vdots$        | $\vdots$        | $\ddots$ | $\vdots$        | $\vdots$
n            | $x_{n1}$        | $x_{n2}$        | $\cdots$ | $x_{np}$        | $y_n$
&nbsp;       | $\mathbf{X}_{1}$| $\mathbf{X}_{2}$| $\cdots$ | $\mathbf{X}_{p}$| $\mathbf{y}$
             
             
$$
\mathbf{X}=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{X}_{1}&\mathbf{X}_{2}&\cdots &\mathbf{X}_{p} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, and |
\boldsymbol{\beta}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\beta_{1} \\
\vdots\\
\beta_{p} \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

 To find the ridge regression estimate, we want to minimize the objective function of form $\left(\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2\right)$.  As constrained optimization, we want to minimize $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\beta \parallel^2$ subject to $\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2 \leq t$ constraint for some constant $t$.  
 

 
 Imagine a contour defined by $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ with its lowest at $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  Now imagine a circle around the origin where the diameter is defined by a tuning parameter $t$ such that it satisfies $\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2 <t$.  Our solution can only be inside this circle.  Without any constraint on $t$, i.e. $t=\infty$ we will get $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ as an estimate that minimizes $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\beta \parallel^2$. But as t gets smaller, we depart from our $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ since the solution has to be within the circle.  Thus, we can see that the solution we want is on the circle closest to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$, which is the point circle that touches the ellipse.  Equivalently, our solution can be thought of as shrinkage.  As t gets smaller, we are shrinking our $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$  toward zero on the diagonal line from $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ to the origin.
 
 ![Ridge Image](Images/Ridge.png)


So lets solve for $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \boldsymbol{\beta}}\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2&=&-2( \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})X +2\lambda\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
&\Rightarrow&  -\mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} + \lambda\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=0\\
&=& \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda I)=\mathbf{y}^TX\\
&=& \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda I)^{-1}\mathbf{y}^TX\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence we see $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{pythonidge}=(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X} +\lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1}\mathbf{y}^T\mathbf{X}$.

##### LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)

The idea of LASSO is similar to Ridge Regression. Using the same setting as before, the only difference is we want to minimize an objective function of the form $\left(\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2+\lambda\mid \boldsymbol{\beta}\mid\right)$ or equivalently perform constraint minimization of $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ subject to $\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid\leq t$ constraint ($\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid=\sum^p_{j=1}\mid \beta_j\mid$).

Geometrically speaking (for $p=2$ case) we want to find $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ that is closest to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$ within the diamond shaped region that is $\mid \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid<t$.
Unlike $L_2$ norm, $L_1$ norm has corners and edges that touch the contour of $\parallel \mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \parallel^2$ first most of the time.  This acts as the variable selector in high-dimensional space.  Thus, when we look at the solution path of LASSO, we see some coefficients take on the value of zero.

As $t$ increases, we gradually see more and more $\boldsymbol{\beta}$s coming into our model.  And this goes on until all $t$ is so big that the diamond shaped region includes $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$, in which case, all the estimates of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ becomes $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  Or conversely, if you decrease your $t$, to zero your estimated  $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ starts to get shrunk toward zero from $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$.  So you can see that we are doing shrinkage estimation. Then, we want to choose $t$ to get the sparsest model with the lowest cross-validation error.

### Proofs

#### Stein's lemma
We first need Stein's lemma.`
\noindent{\bf Stein's Lemma} 
According to Stein's lemma, for $Z\sim N\left(\mu,\sigma^2\right)$, $E\left[(z-\mu)g(z)\right]=\sigma^2E\left[g'(z)\right]$.
\subsubsection*{proof}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[(z-\mu)g(z)\right]&=&\int(z-\mu)g(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}dz\\
&=&-\sigma^2g(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\Bigr|^{\infty}_{-\infty}+\sigma^2\int g'(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{-(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\\
&=&\sigma^2E\left[g'(z)\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

#### Proof: Stein's estimator outperforms LS

We are ready to prove that Stein's estimator outperforms the least square's estimate.  We will denote for the simplicity $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS} = \boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best} =\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta} \parallel ^2&=&E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}\left( \beta_i-\theta_i \right)^2\right]\\
&=&p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\Biggl|\Biggl|\left(1-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right)\boldsymbol{\beta} -\boldsymbol{\theta} \Biggr|\Biggr| ^2\right]&=&E\left[\Biggl|\Biggl| (\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta})-\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}\Biggr|\Biggr|^2\right]\\
&=&E\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2+E\left[\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]-2E\left[ \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}, \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta} \rangle \right]=(*)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $E\left[ \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}-\theta, \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta} \rangle \right]$ can be simplified as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \right] &=& E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\boldsymbol{\beta}_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \boldsymbol{\beta}_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \boldsymbol{\beta}_j^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i \right]\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Letting $\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \boldsymbol{\beta}_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \boldsymbol{\beta}_j^2}\boldsymbol{\beta}_i=g(x_i)$, we can use Stein's lemma. Hence
\begin{eqnarray*}
 E\left[\sum^p_{i=1}(\beta_i-\theta_i)\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \beta_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \beta_j^2}\beta_i \right]&=& \sigma^2\sum^p_{i=1}E\left[\left(\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \beta_i^2+\sum^p_{j\neq i} \beta_j^2}\beta_i \right)'\right]\\
&=&\sigma^2\sum^p_{i=1} E\left[\frac{(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}- \frac{(p-2)\sigma^2 2\beta_i^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&\sigma^2E\left[\frac{p(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}- \frac{2(p-2)\sigma^2}{ \parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&E\left[\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(*)&=&E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2+\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}-2\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\\
&=&E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2-\frac{(p-2)^2\sigma^4}{\parallel \boldsymbol{\beta}\parallel^2}\right]\leq E\left[\parallel\boldsymbol{\beta}-\boldsymbol{\theta}\parallel^2\right] = p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}
